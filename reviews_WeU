0, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Love being part of such incredible history. So proud of my kid. #WESTERNDAD
1, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"I had a double bypass.  Every person from the surgeon, nurses, p.s.w.'s, and room cleaners are professional and personable and treated me with kindness and respect.  Thank you to all!"
2, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Great school and campus. Job opportunities are strong at there business school.
3, 1 star ,2 months ago,I am ashamed of what was my own university forcing an ethics professor from her position at Huron College for teaching and loving the exact thing she was teaching her students to do faithfully for two decades.  Where has an institution gone ‚Ä¶
4, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Seems like a nice looking campus. We came here for a conference and enjoyed walking around the property, there were not many students around in the early summer."
5, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"You should trust your students to make the appropriate decision for themselves. Coercion isn't cool. Everyone understands that vaccines work and have been used for decades, but that doesn't give us the right to force people who may have valid concerns. It is very sad to see free thought stifled."
6, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Lovely campus, well-maintained, gets crowded during the school between Sept and April. A blend of old and new architecture makes for a nice scenic walk through."
7, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,Huge place but runs very efficiently with helpful staff üëè
8, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"No matter where you walk there‚Äôs always a beautiful view! Great university, demands time and real effort. Could be better at guiding students, but felt more like a number in classes here compared to the affiliates. Plenty of students during Fall/Winter term but pretty quiet during the summer."
9, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful campus!  Lots to see when walking around inside and out!  As a student I was treated as a number not a person.  Their priority is clearly to make money, not support their students.  There should be a better balance between the two."
10, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"It‚Äôs the best school to be honest. Western has 5 schools in total (Huron, King‚Äôs, Brescia, Western and Ivey). A lot of fun event and the campus is sooo bigg. Choose your school wisely. I recommend Huron if ur going for business, otherwise choose Western (I did not research for other schools)"
11, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Western has an incredibly beautiful campus teeming with life. It has a good blend of natural and man made element, cementing the fact that you‚Äôre in forest city. Like any university the staff varies in quality but overall the student experience is enjoyable and welcoming!"
12, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Loved my time Western. Great balance of school/work/and play. Lots of events for students to do, great opportunities to learn and good programs. It was difficult getting accommodations for my disability initially but once I got into the system they gave me the supports I needed to be able to graduate. Miss my time at Western!"

On time
Great staff to help

16, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Go Mustangs, completed my BA in Sociology here, second to none! Love Western"
17, 1 star ,2 months ago,I can see why Western has a drinking and party problem when you have a psychology professor promoting to young students the use of alcohol in order to relax.

20, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Not a great university for international students.I did not recieve much support or guidance. Also, some of my classes were very crowded. The views are beautiful though. And the gym was great"
21, 4 stars ,11 months ago,Beautiful campus.
22, 1 star ,2 months ago,"This university stands for coercion and segregation based on medical status
Absolutely shameful to force staffs to mandatory covid jab."
23, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Today was a horrible day for me because the nurses and staff were very rude and not friendly at all.
I feel very disappointed to have had a bad experience like this in a hospital üò¢üò≠üò°"

35, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Had  brain surgery, and every part of the team was so positive and helpful! I would strongly reccomend this hospital."
36, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Western is a world class institution where great minds meet great professors and great students, it's a school with multiple programs for undergraduate, graduate and PhD with experience professors, adequate equipment, research laboratories and serene environment for learning."
37, 1 star ,a year ago,"Terrible place, they care only aboutthe tuitions and you have better chance to study else where. profs are not profs with a knowledge on how to talk to students or even care about them. There are so many better institutions around. but not ‚Ä¶"

49, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Great university experience overall however my Psychology degree has proved me pointless so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing it unless you‚Äôre going to go on to become a psychologist
50, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderfull staff, and doctors in the ER dept. Slow wait times but you can thank sock boy priminister for that!"
51, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Dr.s, nurses and assistants  were great University Hospital in London have the greatest caregivers I have ever met.  London should be proud to stand up for them. Thanks  Ricky Somerville."
52, 5 stars ,6 years ago,I love this school. I spent two years at Brock University before transferring here. You honestly can't even compare the two. This has been the most incredible experience of my life so far and I don't regret my decision at all. This really ‚Ä¶

63, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great treatment at  University Hospital. Every staff member was warm and friendly and so caring. Thanks to Dr Teefy and all his colleagues in Cardiac Catheterization
64, 1 star ,2 years ago,So basically you pay 10k a year to be able to write an exam at the end. Because most Professors don't care if you understand material and you end up studying everything all over at home on your own. Staff is rude and unprofessional. But parties and concerts were lit though that should make up for it right?

81, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Western truly has the best sense of community. London is the biggest small town! The lecturers really do care about your education and the school itself is rapidly diversifying when it comes to culture, LGBT and indigenous education. I am so thankful to have gotten my education here, it truly is the best student experience!"
82, 1 star ,2 years ago,"They are just money making machines, who take money and a lot of your effort in name of application process. Then they simply do not offer admission and their department never ever gets back to you with any sort of feedback.
Rude, pathetic people"

87, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Good scenery and athletic center. Western has decent academic focus, especially in medical science and the Ivey Business school. It also has a good philosophy program. Small class sizes in less selective programs may lead to greater opportunities in research, etc."

95, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"2/10 rating give to this university, first, the campus is beautiful, second, the girls are beautiful. Students experience? Not too beautiful."
96, 1 star ,5 years ago,A few friends now have told me that they can't get jobs there; they're not students/alumni of Western. They say the University of Western only considers its own students and staff for employment.  I say: that's what a university does when its students and staff can't get jobs anywhere else ;)
